Constructing a placeholder with input shapes is too hard. We should be able to just pass in a static shape.
Perhaps there should be a default dtype too?
TVM allows you to query shape of already computed te.Tensor values.
Also, I wonder if there's just unnecessary churn in APIs between NNC and TVM? Like, the order of the arguments.
